## Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Clone
1. Fork the repository on GitHub: [`https://github.com/rdpatel2/Weeklies`](https://github.com/rdpatel2/Weeklies)
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Weeklies.git
   cd Weeklies
   ```
3. Set the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/rdpatel2/Weeklies.git
   ```

### 2. Environment Setup
1. Create and activate a Python 3.11+ virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows PowerShell:
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # Linux/macOS:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Upgrade `pip` and install dependencies:

## Branching Strategy & Workflow

1. Always branch off the latest `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or: fix/issue-description
   # or: docs/update-topic
   ```
2. Keep branches focused on a single topic, bug fix, or feature.
3. Commit messages should be clear and follow conventional commit conventions:
   - `feat: add order cancellation route`
   - `fix: resolve allergen filtering issue`
   - `test: add Cypress tests for login flow`
   - `docs: update installation instructions`
   - `chore: update dependencies`
