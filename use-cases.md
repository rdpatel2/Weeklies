## Coverage summary

The catalog contains 28 use cases:

- 17 customer/visitor goals
- 11 restaurant-owner goals
- Full coverage of implemented account, planning, browsing, ordering, receipt, review, fulfillment, and analytics flows
- Explicit extensions for authentication, ownership, invalid lifecycle transitions, malformed serialized data, unavailable LLM behavior, and best-effort analytics

Capabilities from the old `use_case.md` that remain future scope should receive separate use cases only when the project adopts the relevant actors and subsystems: geolocation/delivery zones, real checkout/payment, promotions, substitutions, driver dispatch/navigation, proof of delivery, refunds, and support disputes.
